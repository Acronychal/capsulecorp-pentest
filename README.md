# Capsulecorp Pentest
The Capsulecorp Pentest is a small virtual network managed by vagrant and ansible.  It contains five virtual machines, including one Linux attacking system running xubuntu and 4 Windows 2019 servers configured with various vulnerable services.  This project can be used to learn network penetration testing as a stand-alone environment but is ultimatly designed to compliment my book [The Art of Network Penetration Testing](https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-network-penetration-testing) 

## Requirements
In order to use the Capsulecorp Pentest network you must have the following:

* VirtualBox
  * [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Vagrant
  * [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

* Ansible
  * [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)

## OSX Configuration
In order to manage Windows hosts you'll have to install `pywinrm` with pip inside the ansible virtual environment

    source ~/ansible/bin/activate
    pip install pywinrm
    deactivate

## Installation
Bring up the virtual machines using vagrant.  First cd into the project directory, for example: `cd ~/capsulecorp-pentest`

    vagrant up

Provision the pentest machine.

    vagrant provision pentest

Setup the Capsulecorp domain controller

    vagrant provision goku
